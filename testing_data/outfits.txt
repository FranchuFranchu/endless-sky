	"energy capacity" 1000
	description "A ship can run without batteries if its generator's instantaneous power output is higher than the total energy consumption of its systems, but batteries make it possible to store up energy when it is not needed and thus to use a much smaller and cheaper generator."

	description "Fuel cells have been the cheapest and most common starship power sources since the dawn of the space era. This model produces only enough power for very small or slow ships."

	description "This mysterious box sits quietly at the heart of your ship, thinking its own inscrutable thoughts. When it comes time to travel between the stars it sets off a nuclear fusion reaction powerful enough to level an entire city, and then somehow tucks the resulting explosion in between the folds of regular space-time like a wasp stinging an oak leaf to lay her eggs inside. Your ship rides the resulting ripple in the fabric of space."
	description "	They say that fewer than a dozen human beings alive today understand the inner workings of the hyperdrive."

	"shield generation" .2
	"shield energy" .2
	description "This is the standard shield generator for fighters and interceptors, as well as for many non-combat starships. Although it is possible for a ship to have no shield generator at all, recharging its shield matrix only when landed in a hospitable spaceport, life in deep space is unpredictable enough that most pilots find shield generators to be well worth the space they take up."

	"flare sound" "ion small"
	description "The X2700 ion thruster is intended mostly for use in small, single-person or two-person ships, as well as in fighters. It is also used in larger ships, such as freighters, that have very little space for propulsion systems or energy to drive them. But these larger ships move unbearably slowly as a result."
	description "	Ion engines consume less energy than plasma engines and produce less heat, but they also take up more space."

	description "The X2200 steering system is designed for fighters and other small spacecraft, as well as for use in larger ships when maneuverability is not needed."
	description "	Ion engines consume less energy than plasma engines and produce less heat, but they also take up more space."
